These are the classes I'm taking or have completed in seeking my Master's degree in Computer Science from CU-Boulder.

# Spring 2018 Classes
* __CSCI 7000:__ [CS Topics: Human-Centered Machine Learning](https://chenhaot.com/courses/hcml/home.html)
  * __Professor:__ [Dr. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/)
  * __Description:__ "Machine learning research has been focusing on improving the capability of machines, which sometimes even outperforms humans. In this course, we will center around humans and explore how we can use machine learning to improve human performance in various scenarios. We will cover topics such as interpretable machine learning, machine teaching, cognitive bias, education, accessibility, etc. This is a research focused class. Students are expected to discuss related papers, work on research proposals, and finish a final project on related topics."
* __CSCI 5822:__ [Probabilistic Models](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/ProbabilisticModelsSpring2018/)
  * __Professor:__ [Dr. Michael Mozer](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php)
  * __Description:__ "In artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the formal language of probabilistic reasoning and statistical inference have proven useful to model intelligence. From a probabilistic perspective, knowledge is represented as degrees of belief, observations provide evidence for updating one's beliefs, and learning allows the mind to tune itself to statistics of the environment in which it operates. One virtue of probabilistic models is that they straddle the gap between cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The same methodology is useful for both understanding the brain and building intelligent computer systems."

* __INFO 5602:__ [Information Visualization](http://danielleszafir.com/syllabi/INFO4602_Syllabus.pdf)
  * __Professor:__ [Dr. Danielle Szafir](http://danielleszafir.com/)
  * __Description:__ "Data is everywhere. Charts, graphs, and other types of information visualizations help people to make sense of this data. This course explores the design, development, and evaluation of these information visualizations. By combining aspects of design, computer graphics, HCI, and data science, you will gain hands-on experience with creating visualizations, using exploratory tools, and architecting data narratives. Topics include interactive systems, user-centered and graphic design, graphical perception and cognition, data storytelling, and insight building. Throughout this course, you will work directly with stakeholders to analyze data from a variety of domains and applications."

# Fall 2017 Classes
* __CSCI 5622:__ [Machine Learning](https://chenhaot.com/courses/csci5622/2017fa/home.html)
  * __Professor:__ [Dr. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/)
  * __Description:__ "Trains students to build computer systems that learn from experience. Includes the three main subfields: supervised learning, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning. Emphasizes practical and theoretical understanding of the most widely used algorithms (neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, Q-learning). Covers connections to data mining and statistical modeling."
* __CSCI 5454:__ [Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/distance-education/course-offerings/comprehensive-course-list/csci-5454-design-analysis-algorithms)
  * __Professor:__ [Dr. Ashutosh Trivedi](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~astr3586/)
  * __Description:__ "Techniques for algorithm design, analysis of correctness and efficiency; divide and conquer, dynamic programming, probabilistic methods, advanced data structures, graph algorithms, etc. Lower bounds, NP-completeness, intractability. Recommended prerequisite: CSCI 2270 or equivalent."
* __CSCI 5832:__ [Natural Language Processing](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/distance-education/course-offerings/comprehensive-course-list/csci-5832-natural-language-processing)
  * __Professor:__ [Dr. James Martin](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/)
  * __Description:__ "Explores the field of natural language processing as it is concerned with the theoretical and practical issues that arise in getting computers to perform useful and interesting tasks with natural language. Covers the problems of understanding complex language phenomena and building practical programs."
