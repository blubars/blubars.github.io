Last semester, I worked on a project to analyze the book <i>Infinite Jest</i> as a network. 
Well, after a few more nights of work, I'm pleased to announce that it's now able to work on **any** book!
It will turn the book into a network of character co-mentions using named entity recognition and a small bit of manual intervention when it's not sure. 

 - Example output [here](https://hneutr.github.io/infinite_jest_webweb/).
 - Code with instructions is open-sourced [here](https://github.com/blubars/NovelNets).
 - Visualizations made using the excellent [webweb](https://webwebpage.github.io/).
