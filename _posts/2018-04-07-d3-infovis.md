As part of my Information Visualization class, we were exposed to D3 for creating web-based interactive visualizations. It's really quite slick. [Here's a link](https://blubars.github.io/info_5602/proj-3/proj3.html) to something I made that I'm particularly proud of. It's a representation of data from Mozilla's 2017 Internet Future of Connectivity Survey. Mozilla's blogpost on the data can be found [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/01/10-fascinating-things-we-learned-when-we-asked-the-world-how-connected-are-you/).

I have to confess that as an embedded C developer, the bloat in these JS libararies and the warning bells at all the async UI stuff, and JS's recent trends at migrating out of the browser and replacing native GUI programs is... well let's just say something I'm not used to. But it has been pretty fun to play around with :D
