This was our Machine Learning (CSCI 5622) final project. We worked with a local Boulder company, [WootMath](https://www.wootmath.com/), to see if we could apply unsupervised learning techniques to the area of personalized learning to automatically recognize types of student mistakes and misconceptions in grade school-level math problems (e.g. simplifying fractions).
