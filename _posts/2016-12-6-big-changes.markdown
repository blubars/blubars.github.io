Some big changes afoot in the life of Brian.

For those who don’t know, I’ve decided to quit my job, apply to grad school, travel in southeast Asia, come back to the US and travel more/volunteer/brush up on my linear algebra and statistics, and then go to grad school. So that’s the plan.

Plans are cheap to make. But this one is special because it’s actually happening! My last day of work is this Friday, 12/9/2016; and I fly to Thailand this Sunday, 12/11/2016. And that is terrifying, but oh so exciting. I’ve had a flood of emotions over the last few months — which I would love to write about later — but for now my overwhelming feeling is stress. I have so much left to do in my college applications, and haven’t even started seriously planning my trip.

This blog may be where I post stuff. We’ll see. Also, instagram/facebook of course, and an experiment with github pages blogging. Also used to have a custom domain and design up using Django, but scrapped that with shifting priorities. Back to basics for now.

My first priority is grad school apps. I’m going back to study AI/Natural Language Processing (NLP). I am extremely interested in it for a variety of reasons, but mostly it’s the most excited I’ve been about writing code in a long, long time (possibly even including when Rust came out!). And I also have some ideas for applications of NLP on my own — ventures that I lack the background for currently. All I want to say about that for now, but more later hopefully.

BUT it’s happening so leggo! Now time to go finish my grad apps.
