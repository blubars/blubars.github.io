  <p>Hi, I'm <b>Brian Lubars</b>. Thanks for taking an interest!</p>

  <p><b>Professionally</b>, I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, <a href="{% link _posts/2018-01-01-school.md %}">studying Computer Science</a>. My interests are mainly machine learning and natural language processing, especially its applications to investigating social science issues. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hYgYQmYgthmU05qGrltzksmQJy8q1LQS">Click here</a> for my resume.</p>

  <p>Prior to my current foray into back into academics, I earned my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2012, and worked for 5 years as an embedded software engineer at Qualcomm in Boulder, CO.</p>

  <p><b>Personally</b>, I'm interested in photography, hiking, backpacking, climbing, philosophy, traveling, and trying to find my place in the world. Also coffee.
