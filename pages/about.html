  <p>Hi, I'm <b>Brian Lubars</b>. Thanks for taking an interest!</p>

  <p><b>Professionally</b>, I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, studying Computer Science. My interests are mainly machine learning and natural language processing, especially its applications to investigating social science issues.</p>

  <p>Prior to my current foray into back into academics, I earned my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2012, and worked for 5 years as an embedded software engineer at Qualcomm in Boulder, CO.</p>

  <p><b>Personally</b>, I'm interested in photography, hiking, backpacking, climbing, philosophy, traveling, and trying to find my place in the world. Also coffee.
