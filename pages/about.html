  I'm a second-year master's student at the University of Colorado Boulder, <a href="{% link _posts/2018-01-01-school.md %}">studying Computer Science</a>. Interested in machine learning and applications to computational social science. Currently focused on human-centered ML, e.g., which tasks are <a href="https://delegability.github.io">delegable to machines</a> and why? Advised by <a href="https://www.chenhaot.com/">Prof. Chenhao Tan</a>.

  <p>Prior to my current foray back into academics, I earned my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2012, and worked for 5 years as an embedded software engineer at Qualcomm in Boulder, CO.
